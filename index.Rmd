__An investigation into American time use trends pre- and post- onset of COVID-19__

# The Project
COVID-19 has drastically impacted the ways in which we spend our time. At the onset of the pandemic in the United States -- March 2020 -- initiation of stay-at-home orders, lockdown measures, and social distancing norms rapidly and severely altered daily activities. From time spent with others to time spent at home, we were interested in exploring pandemic impacts on time use and analyzing how they may differ based on social and demographic characteristics across the United States. 
</p>
Our analysis is largely exploratory, visualizing distribution of activities across states, units of time, and demographics. Additional regression analyses were run to investigate the significance of the associations between demographic variables of interest and time use outcomes.   
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# The Website
The analyses visualized and discussed here rely on publicly available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™ [American Time Use Survey (ATUS)](https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-2020.htm) to investigate time use trends across the United States.
</p>
Exploratory analyses include:
</p>
+ COVID-19's impact on time use
</p>
+ Time use differences by age and sex  
</p>
+ Multi-year time use trends from 2009-2019  

Statistical analyses include linear regressions on time use with the following:
</p>
+ Labor force status 
</p>
+ Main effects of age, race, and sex
</p>
+ Interactive effects of age, race, and sex

Interactive map includes:
</p> 
+ Dashboard visualizing average time use by activity category across states and regions

Project report includes:
</p>
+ An in-depth discussion of the data collection and cleaning processes, exploratory and statistical analysis methodologies, and project results.

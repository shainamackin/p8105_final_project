# Project Motivation 
</p>
COVID-19 has drastically impacted the ways in which we spend our time. During the height of the pandemic, stay-at-home orders, lockdown measures, and social distancing norms prevented many Americans from going into workplaces and schools and from seeing friends and family, impacting the way we spend our days -- and making us hyper aware of that. The motivation for this project was originally to understand how COVID-19 affected time use. We set out to look at how time spent on activities such as paid and unpaid work, education, sleep, and leisure may have changed from pre- to post- pandemic, especially interested in understanding how changes in time use impact our general well-being.

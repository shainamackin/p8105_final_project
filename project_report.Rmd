# Project Motivation 
</p>
COVID-19 has drastically impacted the ways in which we spend our time. During the height of the pandemic, stay-at-home orders, lockdown measures, and social distancing norms prevented many Americans from going into workplaces and schools and from seeing friends and family, impacting the way we spend our days -- and making us hyper aware of that. The motivation for this project was originally to understand how COVID-19 affected time use. We set out to look at how time spent on activities such as paid and unpaid work, education, sleep, and leisure may have changed from pre- to post- pandemic, especially interested in understanding how changes in time use impact our general well-being.

# Related Work
The work that inspired this project was done by the [Our World in Data group](https://ourworldindata.org/time-use). They looked at how  people all around the world spend their days. They point out that looking at how we spend our time -- particularly focusing on how much time we spend on things we enjoy, can be informative about general well-being. In countries where individuals work more, and spend less time on leisure activities, there are lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction.</br>

A lot of individuals have used the specific datasets that we used for this project to do cool things! One example is a simulation built by a statistician at UCLA, who [simulated](https://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/) how 1000 Americans transition from one activity to another over the course of a day. We recommend you check it out.

# The Data
</p>
### Source: <br/>
Data for this project comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey (ATUS), publicly available [here](https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-2020.htm). </p> Key variables from the Activity Summary files included activity codes, total time spent on the activity, and demographic variables. We pulled dates of responses from the ATUS respondent files and geographic information from the CPS files.

### Cleaning: </br>
</p>

We started with the Activity Summary files. Our first step was to pivot from wide to long format, as the approximately 400 activity codes each had their own column. The activity codes (the letter "t" followed by 6 digits) were not very informative, so we also recoded them to be more informative of the activity (ex. t010101 was recoded as "Sleeping"). We categorized activity codes into 16 different categories (caring for and helping others, consumer purchases, eating and drinking, education, government services and civic obligations, household activities, household services, personal care, professional and personal care services, religious and spiritual, leisure, sports/exercise, telephone calls, traveling, volunteering and working) using the category definitions given by ATUS. We would like to note that some activities could have fallen under more than one category (ex. Some may view sports to fall under leisure and some may view it to fall under exercise or both). Other cleaning steps included renaming variable names to be more  informative (ex. TELFS renamed to labor_force_status).  We appended 2019 and 2020 datasets and merged the different datasets were using the ID (TUCASEID) variable.

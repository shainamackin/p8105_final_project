# The Project
COVID-19 has drastically impacted the ways in which we spend our time. From March to May, 2020 -- during the onset of the pandemic in the United States -- initiation of stay-at-home orders, lockdown measures, and social distancing norms rapidly and severely altered daily activities. From time spent with others to time spent in our homes, we were interested in exploring pandemic impacts on time use and analyzing how they may differ based on social and demographic characteristics across the United States. 
</p>
Our analysis is largely exploratory, visualizing distribution of activities across states, units of time, and demographics. We have also run regression analyses to investigate the significance of the associations between demographic variables of interest and time use outcomes.

# The Website
This project uses publicly available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ [American Time Use Survey (ATUS)](https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-2020.htm) to investigate time use trends across the U.S. between 2019 and 2020.

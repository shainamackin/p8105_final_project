## Read in the data

cps_2020 = read.table("data/atuscps_2020.dat", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

The activity summary files contains information about total minutes spent on each activity (I believe respondents were asked to fill out a time diary for one day of the week). There is only one respondent per household. The cps datasets contains geographic information as well as information about each household and each respondent in the household. 

Look into the data and ensure coding has been done correctly

head(activity_2019)

unique(resp_2019$TEHRUSLT) # -1 might be incorrect coding to exclude for hours worked
unique(roster_2019$TESEX)

Let's read in and tidy the cps files that have the geographic information. First we'll select the appropriate columns from cps and then rename the columns to be more useful. Then we'll recode the column values. 

```{r}
cps_2020_sub = cps_2020 %>% #select geographic variables
  select(TUCASEID:GTCO, PRTAGE, PESEX) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2020)

cps_2019_sub = cps_2019 %>% #select geographic variables
  select(TUCASEID:GTCO, PRTAGE, PESEX) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

#stack the 2019 and 2020 cps datasets

cps_combined = rbind(cps_2019_sub, cps_2020_sub) %>%

                            `1` = "metropolitan", 
                            `2` = "non-metropolitan", 
                            `3` = "not identified")) 
```

Merge the cps and summary datafiles. 

```{r}
cps_summary_merged = left_join(actsum_combined_categorized, cps_combined, by = c("TUCASEID", "age", "year", "sex"))

summary_subject_category <- cps_summary_merged %>% #each row is a unique subject ID with unique category, category_sum_min: the sum of mins a subject spent on a specific category during that year; category_sum_hour: the sum of hours a subject spent on a specific category during that year
  group_by(TUCASEID,category) %>% 
  mutate(category_sum_min = sum(total_minutes), 
         category_sum_hour = category_sum_min/60, 
         category_sum_hour_weight = category_sum_hour*weight) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  select(-c("activity_codes","total_minutes"))
```

Let's write a function to do the calculations how many hours are spent on a category of activity daily.

Average daily hours for a category = (sum(minutes spent on category of activity * weight)/sum of weights)/60.

```{r}
daily_time = function(catgry, yr){
  data = cps_summary_merged %>% 
  filter(category == catgry, 
         year == yr) %>% 
  mutate(time_weight_product = total_minutes*weight) %>% 
    group_by(TUCASEID, weight) %>% 
    summarize(weighted_minutes = sum(time_weight_product))
  
  avg_daily = (sum(data$weighted_minutes) / #in hours 
  sum(data$weight))/60
  
  print(avg_daily)

}

daily_time("work", 2019)
daily_time("leisure", 2019)
daily_time("sleep", 2019)

Let's create a function to calculate the average daily time among people who actually engage in the category of activity. 

```{r}
daily_time_2 = function(catgry, yr){
  data = cps_summary_merged %>% 
  filter(category == catgry, 
         year == yr) %>% 
    filter(total_minutes > 0) %>%
  mutate(time_weight_product = total_minutes*weight) %>% 
    group_by(TUCASEID, weight) %>% 
    summarize(weighted_minutes = sum(time_weight_product))
  
  avg_daily = (sum(data$weighted_minutes) / #in hours 
  sum(data$weight))/60
  
  print(avg_daily)

}

daily_time_2("work", 2019)
```


Let's see what the average number of hours spent on leisure activities is by state.
```{r}
leisure_data_state =
  cps_summary_merged %>% 
  filter(category == "leisure") %>% 
  mutate(time_weight_product = total_minutes*weight) %>%  
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(avg_leisure_time = sum(time_weight_product)/weight, 
            n = n()
            )
leisure_data_state = summary_subject_category %>% 
  filter(category == "leisure") %>% 
  group_by(state,year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_leisure_time = sum(category_sum_hour*weight)/sum(weight))

leisure_data_state1 = summary_subject_category %>% 
  filter(category == "leisure") %>%
  group_by(state,year) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),sum(category_sum_hour)/n)

  ##sum(category_sum_hour)/n
  ##sum(category_sum_hour*weight)/sum(weight)
```

Map the average number of hours spent on leisure activities is by state.
```{r}
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)

plot_usmap(data = leisure_data_state, values = "avg_leisure_time", color = "red") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_b(name = "Average leisure time", label = scales::comma, direction = -1) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```

## Plotly 
```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- plotly::plot_geo(leisure_data_state, locationmode = 'USA-states')
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(
    z = ~total.exports, text = ~hover, locations = ~code,
    color = ~total.exports, colors = 'Purples'
  )
fig <- fig %>% colorbar(title = "xx")
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    title = 'xx',
    geo = g
  )

## Regression

Regression analysis with race and time spent on leisure activities
